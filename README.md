## Non-Functional requirements
The project must work in all modern browsers
The project must be responsive (work well and look good on all screen sizes)
The project must be able to support 500 simultaneous users

## Risks
Underestimation of time/resource commitment
On average, we see that students underestimate the amount of time that they themselves will need to invest in the project to move it forward quickly. After all, many of us are already working full-time, and the website design is in addition. All participants in the project should have sufficient time to perform their normal duties. *

## Mockups, Wireframes
*Put here images of your wireframes*

## Future iterations
New features and individuality - that distinguishes us from others is planning and discussing in team, testing and exploring other same projects for that. 
Genius in simplicity is duty, our design will be very user-friendly, because such projects is hard to understand for new users, that is the main reason why people wants to ignore such platforms and still using paper-work, especially in our country.
